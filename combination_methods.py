COMBINATION METHODS module

This module contains definitions forecast combinations methods, which are used
to produce the combine forecasts.

The first input should be a DataFrame with the training data of the following
form: the first column contains the realized values, the other columns contain
individual forecasts, the row index corresponds to time axis. The second input
should be a DataFrame with the test data (i.e. all columns contain individual
forecasts).

The output is a Series containing combined forecasts (predictions) of length
 corresponding to the length of the supplied test DataFrame.

    """
    For this combining method, no training set is actually necessary. The
    predictions can be generated by averaging the individual forecasts supplied
    for testing.
